			<p>Disneyland is a theme park in Anaheim, California, which opened in 1955. It is the only one designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney.

Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring the Stanford Research Institute to perform a feasability study determining an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. The park was designed by a creative team hand-picked by Walt from internal and outside talent. They founded WED Enterprises, the precursor to today's Walt Disney Imagineering. 
Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955. </p>
